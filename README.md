# FIDO2 CTAP2 Javacard Applet

## Overview

This repository contains sources for a feature-rich, FIDO2 CTAP2.1
compatible applet targeting the Javacard Classic system, version 3.0.4. In a
nutshell, this lets you take a smartcard, install an app onto it,
and have it work as a FIDO2 authenticator device with a variety of
features. You can generate and use OpenSSH `ecdsa-sk` type keys, including
ones you carry with you on the key (`-O resident`). You can securely unlock
a LUKS encrypted disk with `systemd-cryptenroll`. You can log in to a Linux
system locally with [pam-u2f](https://github.com/Yubico/pam-u2f).

100% of the FIDO2 CTAP2.1 spec is covered, with the exception of features
that aren't physically on an ordinary smartcard, such as biometrics or
other on-board user verification. The implementation in the default configuration
passes the official FIDO certification test suite version 1.7.17 in
"CTAP2.1 full feature profile" mode.

In order to run this outside a simulator, you will need
[a compatible smartcard](docs/requirements.md). Some smartcards which
describe themselves as running Javacard 3.0.1 also work - see the
detailed requirements.

You might be interested in [reading about the security model](docs/security_model.md).

## Environment Setup and Building the application
1. **Download JavacardKit**: Obtain a copy of [JavacardKit version 3.0.4](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javacard-sdk-downloads.html) (or jckit_303 if you prefer).
2. **Set Environment Variable**: Configure the `JC_HOME` environment variable to point to your JavacardKit directory.
   ```bash
   export JC_HOME=<path_to_your_jckit_directory>
   ```

3. **Run Gradle Build**: Execute the following command to build the JavaCard application, which will produce a `.cap` file for installation.
    ```bash
   ./gradlew buildJavaCard
    ```


## Testing the Application

### Overview
You have multiple options for testing the JavaCard application:

1. **Actual Smartcard**: You can test on a physical smartcard.
2. **Virtual SmartCard**: Alternatively, you can use VSmartCard and JCardSim for quicker and easier testing.

### Detailed Steps

#### Option 1: Using Actual Smartcard
Simply install the `.cap` file onto the smartcard and proceed with testing.

#### Option 2: Using Virtual SmartCard and JCardSim
1. **VSmartCard and JCardSim**: Use these tools for a simulated environment.
2. **Third-Party Testing Suites**: Utilize tools like SoloKey's `fido2-tests` for comprehensive analysis. The `VSim` class can help you get started.

#### Python Tests
1. **Python Test Suite**: Navigate to the `python_tests` directory, which contains Python-language tests.
2. **Run the Tests**: Execute the following commands to set up and run the tests.
   ```bash
   export JC_HOME=<your_jckit>
   ./gradlew jar testJar
   python -m venv venv
   ./venv/bin/pip install -U -r requirements.txt
   ./venv/bin/python -m unittest discover -s python_tests
   ```
3. **Interoperability**: These tests use the Python `python-fido2` library because there is currently no FIDO2 client library for the JVM. You can also test with `libfido2`, Python libraries, or the official FIDO Standards Tests (Javascript).

#### Advanced Settings
- **Fast IPC**: By default, the tests use fast interprocess communication with the JVM, bypassing PC/SC. The tests take less than
fifteen seconds to run, for me, even though there are almost two hundred cases.
- **Customization**: You can modify settings in `python_tests/ctap/ctap_test.py` to enable CTAP traffic logging, allow JVM remote debugging, or use a VSmartCard PC/SC connection.

## Where to go Next

If you just want to install the app, look at [what you can configure](docs/installation.md).

I suggest [reading the FAQ](docs/FAQ.md) and perhaps [the security model](docs/security_model.md).

If you're a really detail-oriented person, you might enjoy reading

There are two compatibility issues in the table above:
1. Google Play Services on Android contains a complete webauthn implementation, but it appears to be
   hardwired to use only "passkeys". If a site explicitly requests a *non-discoverable* credential,
   you will be prompted to use an NFC security key, but this is only CTAP1 and not CTAP2. There's
   nothing fundamentally preventing this from working on Android but the current state of Chrome
   and Fennec are that CTAP2 doesn't, because both use the broken Play Services library. MicroG has
   a fully-working implementation, though! See https://github.com/microg/GmsCore/pull/2194 for PIN
   support.
1. Some browsers support FIDO2 in theory but only allow USB security keys - this implementation
   is for PC/SC, and doesn't implement USB HID, so it will only work with FIDO2
   implementations that can handle e.g. NFC tokens instead of being restricted to USB.
   In order to use a smartcard in these situations you'll need https://github.com/StarGate01/CTAP-bridge ,
   https://github.com/BryanJacobs/fido2-hid-bridge/ , https://github.com/BryanJacobs/FIDOk/ or similar,
   bridging USB-HID traffic to PC/SC.
